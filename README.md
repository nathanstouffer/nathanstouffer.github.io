# About

Hi! I am a software engineer with degrees in both applied mathematics and computer science.
I have a deep love for learning and enjoy working on hard problems.

I have a special interest in working with computer graphics as it is a particularly challenging combination of mathematics and computer science (e.g. vectors/matrices, computational geometry, multithreading, real-time response, and many more areas!).

On this site, you will see some projects that I have chosen to highlight.
